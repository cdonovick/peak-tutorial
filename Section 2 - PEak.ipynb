Next we define a `PE` class which contains 3 `ALU`s.  The `PE` has 4 data inputs (`in_0`, ..., `in_3`) and 3 bit control singal (`ops`) which controls the `ALU`s. "

By having specialized compilation flows we allow the SMT family to rewrites `if` statements to `ite`s, and the magma family rewrites the `if`s and wraps the resulting hwtypes program in a circuit.  While the full details of the rewrites used by the SMT and Magma are quite complex, they are fairly straight forward for simple examples.  For example the body of the `ALU`'s `__call__` method would be rewritten to a hwtypes program symantically equivalent to the following:\n",

This module defines a *family group*, a family group is an object (typically a module) with attributes `PyFamily`, `SMTFamily`, and `MagmaFamily`.  Each of these attributes define the type of a family within the family group.  The purpose of a family group is to allow uniform access to types whose implementation may differ between interpretation.  While the base family simply provides type constructors from primitive types, a family group may provide implementations of complex modules such as memories or floating point units.\n",
