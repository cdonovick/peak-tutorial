    "It should be noted that the formal model generated by PEak cannot be used to verify the RTL generated by PEak.  Showing equivelence between the formal model and the RTL would simply show that the PEak compiler's back-ends for SMT and RTL are consistent (of course, such a check could be useful for finding bugs in the PEak compiler, but not for verifying the RTL).\n",

    "PEak circuits are defined in a python class.  Similar to hwtypes, a PEak program can be executed in pure python, symbolically executed to produce SMT formulas, or used to generate a circuit with Magma.  PEak circuits declare subcomponents in their `__init__` method and define their behavior in their `__call__` method.  The aim is to match the semantics of a \"normal\" python programs.  \n",

    "In the following example, we demonstrate the type of program we aim to be able to write.  First we define an `ALU` class which performs either an add or a multiply on two data inputs (`in_0`, `in_1`) and is controlled by a single bit `op`.  Next, we define a `PE` class which contains 3 `ALU`s.  The `PE` has 4 data inputs (`in_0`, ..., `in_3`) and a 3-bit control singal (`ops`), which controls the `ALU`s. "

    "The above will work with python values (as shown); however, as is, this code cannot generate SMT or RTL.  This is because the it is still fundamentally a hwtypes program and is hence subject to the restrictions in the previous section, i.e., an `if` statement can only be evaluated on constant values, and RTL requires a Magma wrapper circuit.  PEak removes these restrictions by compiling `if` statement into `ite`s and automatically generating a wrapper circuit. To evoke the PEak compiler some boiler plate must be added.  Below, we show how to extend the above example using PEak (code points of interest are labeled with comments `# k`)."

    "`family.compile` (`# 4`) invokes the PEak compiler, passing the current namespace to the compiler with `locals(), globals()`.  Each family defines its own compilation flow. By having specialized compilation flows, we allow the SMT family to rewrite `if` statements to `ite`s, while the Magma family rewrites the `if`s <mark>to multiplexers?</mark> and wraps the resulting hwtypes program in a circuit.  While the full details of the rewrites used by the SMT and Magma implementations are quite complex, they are fairly straightforward for simple examples.  For example, the body of the `ALU`'s `__call__` method would be rewritten to a hwtypes program semantically equivalent to the following:\n",

This module also defines a *family group*; a family group is an object (typically a module) with attributes `PyFamily`, `SMTFamily`, and `MagmaFamily`.  Each of these attributes defines the type of a family within the family group.  The purpose of a family group is to allow uniform access to types whose implementation may differ between interpretations.  While the default family group simply provides type constructors for the primitive types, a family group may provide implementations of complex modules such as memories or floating point units.\n",
